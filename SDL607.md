## Findings

- SDL607 device has it's own battery, own air pumping mechanism, LCD screen which reports parameters live, has nice sleep-awake mode (reading every 5 minutes for 30 seconds)
- not ready for outdoor (temp work from spec: 5 - 45 C) used only indoor, but indoor conditions follow outdoor conditions (only PM is more slowly dropping than outside with e.g. wind)
- readings affected by raised humidity (e.g. cooking with steam) no correction mechanism for that
- first 30 seconds of readings after on is not correct, but after it runs stabile
